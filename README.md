# Module 1
### Question 1: Which of the following are ways in which the Layers pattern structures software apps and infrastructure (choose all that apply): 

* Provides services beyond the operating system and protocol stacks to enable components in a distributed system to communicate and manage data
* Enables end-to-end communication by specifying how data should be (un)packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received
* ***Partitions an overall system architecture into groups of subtasks***
* ***Decomposes groups of subtasks into levels of abstraction***

### Question 2: Which of the following are reasons that layering is applied in Android (choose all that apply):    
* ***Reduces the complexity of APIs that app developers must understand***
* Increases context switching, synchronization, and data copying overhead
* ***Enhances systematic software reuse***
* ***Enables "plug and play" replacement of certain layer implementations*** 

### Question 3: Which of the following are implications of being "higher" in the memory hierarchy of a modern computing device (choose all that apply):

* ***Cost is greater***
* ***CPU access latency is lower***
* Memory bandwidth is slower    
* CPU access latency is higher    

### Question 4: Which of the following are correct statements of Android linux RAM (choose all that apply):    
* Apps running in user space can never access RAM of other apps
* ***Android Linux executes in kernel space RAM***
* User space is a less restrictive protection domain than kernel space    
* ***All Android apps execute in user space RAM***

### Question 5: Which of the following are true statements about Android's local and remote inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms (choose all that apply):
* UNIX domain sockets are used to communicate with remote UNIX servers
* ***These IPC mechanisms reside within the kernel's device driver framework***
* ***TCP/IP is used to access the Internet***
* The Binder driver supports highly optimized LAN and WAN communication

### Question 6: Which of the following are true statements about processes in Linux (choose all that apply):    
* ***A process provides a unit of resource allocation and protection***
* ***A process contains one thread by default***
* A process provides units of execution for instruction streams that run on processor cores
* Processes appear at multiple layers in the Android software stack    

### Question 7: Which of the following are true statements about the Android Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) (choose all that apply):

* ***It shields higher layers of Android's software stack from Linux kernel idiosyncracies***
* It is implemented in kernel space to optimize performance and is written largely in C
* It's open source license ensures that all HAL driver implementations are available in open-source form
* It is implemented in user space and is written largely in Java    
* ***Android apps rarely access the HAL directly***
* ***It is implemented in user space and is written largely in C/C++***

### Question 8: Which of the following are true statements about the the "Android Runtime" (ART) execution environment that are not true for the Dalvik VM execution environment (choose all that apply):

* ***It provides a better garbage collector***
* It provides a Just-in-Time (JiT) compiler
* ***It provides an "Ahead-of-Time" (AOT) compiler***
* It executes standard Java Bytecode

### Question 9: Which of the following are examples of app components available in Android core libraries (choose all that apply):

* Phasers
* Threads
* ***Activity***
* ***Content Provider***
* ***Service***
* Stamped Locks

### Question 10: Which of the following are benefits of the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) (choose all that apply):

* ***It can help enhance performance by minimizing latency and maximizing throughput***
* It provides a managed runtime environment for executing Java garbage collection efficiently
* ***It can help integrate existing C/C++ libraries into Android apps***
* It can help improve portability across heterogeneous Java platforms
